# nuxt-netlify-function-demo

This is just a demo to see how Netlify functions work inside a Nuxt project.

It uses the [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/products/dev/) to run the project.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
